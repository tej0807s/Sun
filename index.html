            The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated
            to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light,
            ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on
            Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass
            is about 330,000 times that of Earth; it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar
            System.[20] Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium
            (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.

            Core – the innermost 20–25% of the Sun's radius, where temperature and pressure are sufficient for nuclear
            fusion to occur. Hydrogen fuses into helium (which cannot itself be fused at this point in the Sun's life).
            The fusion process releases energy, and the core gradually becomes enriched in helium.
            Radiative zone – Convection cannot occur until much nearer the surface of the Sun. Therefore, between about
            20–25% of the radius, and 70% of the radius, there is a "radiative zone" in which energy transfer occurs by
            means of radiation (photons) rather than by convection.
            Tachocline – the boundary region between the radiative and convective zones.

            During a total solar eclipse, when the disk of the Sun is covered by that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's
            surrounding atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition
            region, the corona and the heliosphere.The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region
            extending to about 500 km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100 K. This part of the
            Sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water, which can
            be detected via their absorption spectra.

        <p>
            The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and
            coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are
            emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams
            of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.
